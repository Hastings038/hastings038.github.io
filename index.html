    <h1>Hello, I’m Michael</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my GitHub page! </p>
    <p> My nursing background has equipped me with strong written and verbal communication skills, candor, and a naturally curious mindset. 
    Core values such as care and commitment have consistently guided my professional journey. 
    My curiosity about cybersecurity was sparked by seeing how vital secure systems are in protecting sensitive information and ensuring trust in healthcare, 
    which led me to begin studying the field in my free time while continuing to work full-time in healthcare. 
    The skills I developed through years in healthcare are critical thinking, attention to detail, and resilience under pressure, which are proving invaluable as I expand my knowledge and pursue a career in cybersecurity.</p>
