# Cybersecurity-Portfolio
My nursing background has established strong written and verbal communication skills, candour and a curious nature. 
My personal values that have transferred into my professional career are care and commitment.
I have always had a drive to learn and curiousity for cybersecurity.
I have decided to pursue this in my free time whilst working in healthcare full time. 
My curisosity was well founded and the skills I have long establishsed in healthcare and proving invalubale in this learning.
